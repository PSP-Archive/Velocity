::Description::
Velocity is a free library written by Gabriel Anderson(ZettaBlade). You may contact him at zettablade@hotmail.com
Velocity's purpose is to make developing programs on the Sony PlayStation Portable easier but keep
all of the speed you maintain by using the raw PSPSDK. Thus, Velocity was born.
